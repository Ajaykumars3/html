            In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, 
            usually supporting branches and leaves. In some usages,
             the definition of a tree may be narrower, including only wood plants
              with secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants 
              above a specified height. In wider definitions, the taller palms, 
              tree ferns, bananas, and bamboos are also trees. Trees are not a
               taxonomic group but include a variety of plant species that have 
               independently evolved a trunk and branches as a way to tower above
                other plants to compete for sunlight. The majority of tree species
                 are angiosperms or hardwoods; of the rest, many are gymnosperms o
                 r softwoods. Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching several 
                 thousand years old. Trees have been in existence for 370 million 
                 years. It is estimated that there are some three trillion mature 
                 trees in the world.[1] </p><br>
